# Home security system

This project is a simple home security system. 
We used **ESP32** board and two sensors (a **photoresistor** and a **temperature/humidity** sensor). 
For the client side the **WiFiClientSecure** library was used.
The cryptography was implemented using the Python **SSL library** and **PyCryptodome**.
